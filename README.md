Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The client was Artemis Finaancial who is a financial institution who were looking to increase their security to help keep their information protected and secure. 
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
Having secure code is important to ensure that the information is protected. Since they are a financial institution they had clients personal information that does not need to be exposed to any non authorized users. I found it interesting to check the code using the maven dependency check. Protecting the organization and the clients info will help keep the integrity of the organization.
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
I found the dependency check to be the most helpful since it checked all the vulnerabilities for you versus having to do that manually.
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
The layers of security were increased through updating old libraries to the current ones resulting in it to become more secure. To make the program more secure in the future, i would reccomend using penetration testing.
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure that the code was functional, I would often debug the code to make sure that it was actually functional. Once code had been refractored, I would recheck through the dependency checker to ensure that no new vulnerabilities were found.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used google or stackoverflow to help with figuring out what certain errors meant and how to resolve the issue. 
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
The hash function to be able to send encrypted messages.
